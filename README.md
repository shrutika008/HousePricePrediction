# HousePricePrediction

This project aims to predict house prices using the Ames Housing Data, a well-known dataset in the field of real estate and housing. The dataset contains various features of residential properties in Ames, Iowa, including information on the size, location, amenities, and sale prices of houses.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices based on the available features in the Ames Housing Data. By creating an efficient predictive model, it can help homeowners, real estate agents, and potential buyers in making informed decisions related to property pricing.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Ames Housing Data," which can be found at (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset). It consists of a comprehensive set of features for a large number of residential properties. Each property's sale price is also provided, which serves as the target variable for our predictive model.

# Technologies Used
The project utilizes various Python libraries and tools for data analysis, data preprocessing, and machine learning model building. Some of the key technologies used include:

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Scikit-learn
5. Matplotlib
6. Jupyter Notebook

# Project Steps
1. Data Acquisition: Obtain the Ames Housing Data either from the provided source or the official website.

2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Perform data exploration to understand the dataset's structure, check for missing values, outliers, and data types. Clean the data and handle any missing or erroneous information.

3. Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from the dataset, create new features if necessary, and handle categorical variables through encoding or one-hot encoding.

4. Data Visualization: Use various charts and graphs to visualize the relationships between features and the target variable, identify patterns, and gain insights.

5. Model Building: Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, etc.). Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

6. Model Evaluation: Utilize appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared, etc.) to assess the model's accuracy and determine if any adjustments or improvements are required.
  
7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance.

8. Prediction: Apply the trained model to predict house prices for new, unseen data.

9. Conclusion: Summarize the findings, discuss the model's strengths and limitations, and suggest possible areas of improvement.
